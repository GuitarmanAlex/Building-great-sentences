Introduction

we live in a world of words.
digital media inundate us with language in a 24/7 barrage never possible in the world of printer's ink.
...and a cascade of electronic texts give us expand opportunities to share our writing with others.
even in the age of S and FB we continue to interact with others through writing.
more and more it is important that we represent ourselves to the world through writing that is effective-clear,precise,satisfyingly informative writing that reveals the individuality and sophistication of our thinking.
and we cannot be effective writers without writing effective sentences.

whatever the medium,print or digital,our basic unit of communication is the sentence.
good sentences are alive.
we experience them in time,and we react to their unfolding as they twist and turn,challenging us,teasing us,surprising us,and sometimes boring and confusing us as we read them.
this book will explore the ways we can make our sentences better.
to accomplish that we need to understand how making our sentences longer or shorter can make them more effective,more informative,more satisfying.
we need to understand how taking control of building and trimming our sentences can improve our writing.

our goals will be to learn about how sentences work,what they do,and how we can think and talk about them in ways that will help both our own writing and our understanding of prose style.
we will stretch our sense of all the things a sentence can be or do.
we will explore the mysterious concept of "style" to discover what style does and does not mean.
this is a book in which we will dance with language,not a book in which we will trudge toward remedial correctness.
